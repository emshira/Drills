# Question: pets = ["Scooby", "Soco", "Summer", "Pixie", "Wilson", "Mason","Baron", "Brinkley", "Bella"]
# Write a method that takes in the pets array as a parameter. Inside that method, iterate over the array using the each method. If the name starts with an “S”, output the message “My name starts with an S for super!” If the name does not begin with an “S” output the message: “I’m still pretty special too!”.
#
#
# Step one:
# pets = ["Scooby", "Soco", "Summer", "Pixie", "Wilson", "Mason", "Baron", "Brinkley", "Bella"]
#
# pets.each do |name|
#   if name.start_with? 'S'
#     puts "My name starts with an S for super!"
#   else
#     puts "I'm still pretty special too!"
#   end
# end
#
# Step two: put into an method
# pets = ["Scooby", "Soco", "Summer", "Pixie", "Wilson", "Mason", "Baron", "Brinkley", "Bella"]
#
#
# def letter_S(array)
#   array.each do |name|
#     if name.start_with? 'S'
#       puts "My name starts with an S for super!"
#     else
#       puts "I'm still pretty special too!"
#     end
#   end
# end
